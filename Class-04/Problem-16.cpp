Suppose a/b+c=d is an equation. What will be the value of a, b, c and d. So that for their values equation becomes true. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
For this problem, you can pic any value for a, b, c and d. Suppose if we take a=1, b=1, c=1 then left side will be 2. As left is equal to right side we can pic value 2 for d. 
In this type of problem you can create your own answer.
  
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a, b, c, d;
    // a=1
    // b=1
    // c=1
    // d=2;

    cout<<"1 1 1 2"<<endl;
}
