Suppose a/b+c=d/e is an equation. What will be the value of a, b, c, d and e. So that for their values equation becomes true. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
For this also we can pick any value for a, b, c, d and e. If we pic a=1, b=1 and c=1 then left side will be 2. As left side is equal to right side, if we take d=2 and e=1 then 
right side will also be 2. So, the answer can be a=1, b=1, c=1, d=2 and e=1.
  
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a, b, c, d, e;
    // a=1
    // b=1
    // c=1
    // d=2;
    // e=1

    cout<<"1 1 1 2 1"<<endl;
}
